Run the vacuole_track.ipynb file. It should take about 2-3 minutes per xml file (raw data available on heiDATA after accpetance of the manuscript).
After looping over all the .xml files, you should produce 7 .csv files

These 7 csv files are in vacuole_plot folder and are used for plotting the plots in the publication. Run the circular_plot.ipynb in the vacuole_plot folder to produce the plots.
